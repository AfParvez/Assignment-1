            <p>
                New year new resolution for everyone. People make new resolution to be a better self from the previous
                years. This is a kind of a trend now a days. My new resolution is to focus on web-development and to
                know more about software engineering. Hope Mission 2022 goes well for everyone. Stay focused, stay on
                track !
